# Overview

Asteroids for Android is a demonstration app for using Kotlin to make an Android game. To use the game, the left side of the screen acts as a d-pad to move your ship around. The right side fires your weapon when tapped.

I created this app to learn how to make a simple graphics program for Android using Kotlin.

# Development Environment

To create this game I used Android Studio 2022.3.1 and Kotlin. No non standard libraries or frameworks were used.

Kotlin was used to program the game. Kotlin is an object oriented language that is built on Java and is compatible with Java libraries. It is often described as "expressive".
